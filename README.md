# Implement vision transformer from scratch + Cifar-10 dataset (image classification)
## Highlights:
In this repository, we will:
1. Explore the paper [AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf).
2. Implement the vision transformer model from scratch.
3. Train the model and predict on the [Cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Understand the ViT paper
Vision Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced as an alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. They are designed to apply the self-attention mechanism to image data, which has been successful in natural language processing tasks.
